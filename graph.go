// A Graph ensures the behavior of an undirected graph, necessary to run certain algorithms on it.

// simply return two edges for each one of your edges, with the Head and Tail swapped in each one.

	NodeList() []Node                    // Returns a list of all node IDs in no particular order, useful for determining things like if a graph is fully connected. The caller is free to modify this list (so don't pass a reference to your own list)

// Directed graphs are characterized by having seperable Heads and Tails in their edges. That is, if node1 goes to node2, that does not necessarily imply that node2 goes to node1.
//
// While it's possible for a directed graph to have fully reciprocal edges (i.e. the graph is symmetric) -- it is not required to be. The graph is also required to implement UndirectedGraph
// because it can be useful to know all neighbors regardless of direction; not because this graph treats directed graphs as special cases of undirected ones (the truth is, in fact, the opposite)

// A Graph that implements Coster has an actual cost between adjacent nodes, also known as a weighted graph. If a graph implements coster and a function needs to read cost (e.g. A*), this function will

// If no edge exists between node1 and node2, the cost should be taken to be +inf (can be gotten by math.Inf(1))

// A Mutable Graph is a graph that can be changed in an arbitrary way. It is useful for several algorithms; for instance, Johnson's Algorithm requires adding a temporary node and changing edge weights.
// Another case where this is used is computing minimum spanning trees. Since trees are graphs, a minimum spanning tree can be created using this interface.
//
// Note that just because a graph does not implement MutableGraph does not mean that this package expects it to be invariant (though even a MutableGraph should be treated as invariant while an algorithm
// is operating on it), it simply means that without this interface this package can not properly handle the graph in order to, say, fill it with a minimum spanning tree.
//
// In functions that take a MutableGraph as an argument, it should not be the same as the Graph argument as concurrent modification will likely cause problems in most cases.
//
// Mutable graphs should always record the IDs as they are represented -- which means they are sparse by nature.

	SetEdgeCost(e Edge, cost float64)     // The behavior is undefined if the edge has not been created with AddEdge (or the edge was removed before this function was called). For a directed graph only sets node1->node2

// A DStarGraph is a special interface that allows the DStarLite function to be used on a graph
//
// D*-lite is an algorithm that allows for the graph representation to change when actions are taken, whether this be from actions taken by the agent or simply new information gathered.
// As such, there's a Move function, that allows the graph to take into account an agent moving to the next node. This is always followed by a call to ChangedEdges.
//
// Traditionally in D*-lite, the algorithm would scan every edge to see if the cost changed, and then update its information if it detected any changes. This slightly remixed step
// allows the graph to provide notification of any changes, and even provide an alternate cost function if it needs to. This can be used to speed up the algorithm significantly
// since the graph no longer has to scan for changes, and only updates when told to. If changedEdges is nil or of len 0, no updates will be performed. If changedEdges is not nil, it
// will update the internal representation. If newCostFunc is non-nil it will be swapped with dStar's current cost function if and only if changedEdges is non-nil/len>0, however,
// newCostFunc is not required to be non-nil if updates are present. DStar will continue using the current cost function if that is the case.
